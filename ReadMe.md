## Clustered Data Warehouse

Suppose you are part of a scrum team developing a data warehouse for Bloomberg to analyze FX deals. One of the customer stories is to accept deals details and persist them into DB.

## Test Application
To test the application you should have java 8, and mysql installed on your pc first,
then add the mysql configuration according to your mysql server in application.properties file 
and after running the application you can test by uploading sample file provided in sample folder inside the project.
